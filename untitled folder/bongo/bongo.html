<h1> Bongo - <i> Tragelaphus eurycerus </i> </h2> <!--I learned that all animals had scientific names which I didn't know-->

<h1> Bongo Habitat </h1> <!--I made the bongo habitat the first paragraph becuase I thought it should be the first thing a person reads about the bongo to get the genral ide of it-->
<p> The Bongo is mostly found in  the dense forests of eastern, western, and central Africa. 
The Bongo species can be located in other countries, but with its decreasing rate we do not see much of it anymore.
It is now considered to be extinct from a number of different regions today. There are two different
types of the bongo species, one consisting of the Lowlands and the other consisting of the mountain species. The
Lowlands like to stay and live in the dense lowland forests and bamboo thickets of Western and Central Africa. The mountain
Bongos on the other hand are now restricted to just four areas in Kenya after having disappeared from Uganda. 
The Bongo populations have decreased rapidly, but mainly through the form of deforestation. </p>

<h1> Bongo Extinction </h1> <!-- I find this paragraph to be the most timportant bcause it is mostly what this project is about-->
<p> The Bongo is a herbivore which means it survives on only eating plants, this is the only way they gain nutrition.
 They usually feed at night to keep away from other predators that they share their habitats with. They are prey to many other animals 
 around them one consisting of leopards and lions. Another cause of their extinction is that they are
 prone to disease with the entire population having been nearly wiped out in the late 1800s. Another way they are becoming extinct is not only from humans 
 hunting them but from making way for agriculture and gathering the woods of their forest. </p>

<h1> Bongo Fun Facts </h1> <!--This paragraph wasnt necasarry but I thought it should be added because I found the facts to be interesting-->
<p> The bongo itself is a very interesting and cool animal, it has many unique factors. For example to help themselves cool down in the heat they 
wallow in the mud, then after rub on a tree to polish their horns. Many of the native people think the Bongo is this very negative animal, so not only do they refuse to eat it they feel even touching it will
cause them to have spasms. The bongo is not yet totally extinct there still remains about 75 individual species of the mountain bongo left in the highland forests of Kenya, where they are now protected. Although the 
Lowland Bongo is rarer there still seems to be some left in Western Africa. </p>
