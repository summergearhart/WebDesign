		<h2>	All Beaches are Amazing!!! </h2> 
		 <h3>    All about beaches and why everyone should visit them in their lifetime! </h3> 
	<p> In this website I am stressing why beaches are such an amazing place to go. There are many types of beaches for different people. I will be showing you not only three of my
	favorite beaches, but three completely different types of beaches for all different types of people to go to. </p> 
</header>
	<main>
	<p> First, every person should go to one of their "local" beaches. I live in Wilmington, DE so the Delaware beaches aren't that close to me, they are 
	about 2 hours away. The Delaware Beaches consist of Rehoboth, Lewis, and Dewey. My favorite out of those three has to be Dewey because of the great places around there to eat, and mostly 
	since most of my friends go there. So of course not everyones local beach will be the same, but I suggest everyone go to theirs to check it out and see what yours has to offer.</p>
	<p> Second, every person should visit Florida for their great weather and great beaches. The beaches there are all so much fun it's crazy!! Not only do they have great beaches Florida has so many
	other great things to offer. Some of these things are the weather is always very nice and they have amazing places to eat. In my opinion Miami beaches are the best Florida has to offer. I find them to be
	the most fun and the people their are always positive and nice, but that's coming from my own personal experiences.</p>
	<p> Lastly, if you live in the US you should always go out of the country to a tropical place. If you are looking for a fun place for the kids and adults to have a great time I highly suggest going to the 
	Bahamas. This is because of the great place Atlantis which includes an amazing waterpark, one of the best and has a beach right outside of it. If looking for a more 
	laid-back and chill place I suggest Mexico mainly because of the amazing resorts it has to offer. You can pick your resort based on what you want in the vacation!! </p>
	
	
	<p> I hope you take what I had to say into consideration and get yourself out there to these amazing places for a once and a life time experience. If you looked more into 
	these beaches and don't find them interesting, there are so many more to choose from!!</p>
